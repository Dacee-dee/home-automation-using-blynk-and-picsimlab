# home-automation-using-blynk-and-picsimlab
Comprehensive home automation system using Arduino, Blynk, and Picsimlab. Control temperature, water tank, and garden lights. Enhance comfort, efficiency, and convenience.

## Home Automation Project

A comprehensive home automation system built using Arduino, Blynk, and the Picsimlab simulator. The project automates various tasks, including temperature control, water tank monitoring, and garden light management, to enhance comfort, efficiency, and convenience.

### Key Features

- **Temperature Control:** Regulate the indoor climate through temperature sensors and actuators. Use the Blynk app for remote control and monitoring.

- **Water Tank Monitoring:** Monitor water tank levels in real-time using water level sensors. Receive notifications through the Blynk app to prevent water shortages.

- **Garden Light Management:** Control garden lights remotely. Switch them on/off or schedule lighting patterns for aesthetics and security.

### Technologies Used

- Arduino: Central control unit interfacing with sensors, actuators, and appliances.

- Blynk: User-friendly mobile app for remote control, monitoring, and notifications.

- Picsimlab Simulator: Virtual hardware testing and simulation.

### Project Structure

- `ArduinoCode/`: Contains the Arduino code for the home automation system.

### How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Home-Automation-Project.git`.

2. Set up the Arduino environment and upload the code to your Arduino board.

3. Follow the instructions in the `Documentation/` folder to configure and use the Blynk app.
